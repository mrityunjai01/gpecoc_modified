# Basic Configuration

version:
  Must be changed every time you run the program,
  or data will be over written and become useless.

dataName:
  Used for debuging.

aimFolder:
  Used for debuging.

generations:
  #generations for Genetic Programming.

populationSize:
  populationSize for Genetic Programming.

n_jobs:
  setted to 1, don't change that.

freq_stats:
  setted to 1, don't change that.

n_neighbors:
  hyper params for KNN, it will be used when you choose KNN as base classifier.

mutationRate, crossoverRate:
  mutationRate, crossoverRate for Genetic Programming.

growMethod:
  setted to "ramped" as mentioned in the paper, don't change that.

root_path:
  The root path for your project, the suggested path is D:\gpecoc.
  NOTE: permission ISSUES will occur is you put the project in 'C' disk(system disk).
